### Interest Rate Configuration

The system supports flexible interest rate configuration:

```python
# Example: Configure different rates based on loan amount
Amount Slab 1: Rs. 1,000 - Rs. 10,000 @ 3% per month
Amount Slab 2: Rs. 10,001 - Rs. 50,000 @ 2.5% per month
Amount Slab 3: Rs. 50,001+ @ 2% per month
```

### Calculation Methods

**Flat Interest Rate:**
- Total Interest = Principal √ó Rate √ó Tenure
- Monthly Payment = (Principal + Total Interest) √∑ Tenure

**EMI (Reducing Balance):**
- EMI = [P √ó r √ó (1+r)^n] √∑ [(1+r)^n - 1]
- Where P = Principal, r = monthly rate, n = tenure

frappe.call({
    method: "custom_loan.utils.get_loan_calculator_data",
    args: {
